# Schedule-free variational message-passing

We want message passing in ForneyLab to be free of an explicit message scheduler, which allows for scaling to larger graphs. There are a number of potential procedures for local message-passing that converge to similar beliefs as the scheduler. We are studying technical issues and efficiency.

This repo is closed until deemed mature.
